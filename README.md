# Project Assignment

This repository contains a simple **NestJS** backend and a **React** frontend.

## Server

The `server` folder holds a minimal NestJS application. After running `npm install` to install dependencies, run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript and `npm start` to start the server.

## Client

The `client` folder holds a basic React application bundled with webpack. After installing dependencies you can run `npm start` to serve the frontend.
